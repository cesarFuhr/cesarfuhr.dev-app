# About

I'm a Go developer aiming to excel on the software engineering practice.

That being said, I'm working with Ardan Labs and finding my way through every day engineering challenges. Previously I've worked with Getnet Brazil in the payment industries focusing on developing a payment processing API backend, in node.js.

I'm also quite keen on Linux and enjoy spending time on my beloved config files...
