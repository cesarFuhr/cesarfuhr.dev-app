      <section class="text">

        <p>In the last weeks I've been thinking about this little project that I'm working on, which is my own personal blog. I read about having a portfolio page and it seemed like a good idea, but, since I mainly work with backend, it could be quite challenging finding a way to showcase my work without exposing sensitive information of the projects I'm part of.</p>
        <p>So, here I am, instead of going with an established media service, like Medium or LinkedIn, I decided to build my own website and, hopefully, turn it in a interesting resource to the devs out there. I know, I know this first paragraphs are not about HTTPS or TLS, or even Go, but I felt like, since this is my first post, I could talk a little about my motivations.</p>
        <p>I really dig into the simplicity mindset behind all things Go, still, when I started my personal blog project, I thought: "this could be a nice opportunity to test my docker skills". And there I was, thinking about nginx and docker-compose...but...</p>
        <p>I am a Go developer after all, so how hard could it be to build it myself?</p>
        <p>Turns out its not hard at all...</p>

          <h2>The long answer</h2>
        </a>

        <p>Every time I stop to think about it, impressed by how much can be done with Go standard library. It gives you many clean and extensible API's that can carry you a long way before you need to reach out for third party libraries and a HTTPS server is not a exception.</p>
        <p>If you ever coded any simple HTTP server in Go you are only a few lines away from the HTTPS implementation. Since I'm not aiming to talk about how HTTPS guts work, I'll defer that to other articles, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">this</a> (from Wikipedia itself) and <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2021/go-https-servers-with-tls/">this</a> (written by <a href="https://github.com/eliben"> Eli Bendersky</a>). You can check that out if want to know more about HTTPS, but, in Go, the simplest form is as simple as a handler function definition and a function call.</p>

        <pre><code class="language-go">//main.go
package main

import (
  "io"
  "log"
  "net/http"
)

const port = "8443"

func main() {
  http.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, World!\n")
  })

  log.Printf("Starting server at port %s", port)
  // Here you pass as parameters the certificate and key to be used.
  // The last parameter is a http.Handler, if you pass nil the default
  // http handler will be used.
  err := http.ListenAndServeTLS(":"+port, "cert.pem", "key.pem", nil)
  log.Fatal(err)
}</code></pre>

        <p>You may be asking yourself if this is capable of serving production or if it fits only a simple test server. Well, that's the beauty of Go's standard library, the solutions are really robust. I've ran a little test using <a href="https://github.com/tsenart/vegeta">Vegeta</a>, my machine is not exactly a beefy one, but the results were no joke.</p>

          <h3>Multiple certificates</h3>
        </a>
        <p>This is all great, but what if you wanted to serve two different domains with the same Go program? </p>
        <p>Not a problem, Go standard library supports multiple certificates. It is not only supported, but the standard library implementation will select the correct certificate for the requested URL. I used this feature to implement the "wildcard" and the "naked" domains in my server (that is serving you this blog post right now...).</p>

        </a>
        <p>If you miss the days where deploying an application was simply to copy some files to the server, this next section is for you.</p>
        <p>Since <a href="https://go.dev/doc/go1.16">1.16</a> Go has a feature that I'm in love with: Embed. Long story short, embed gives you the possibility of including static files on the final binary. This means that instead of copying a bunch of files around you could embed the files in the binary and have a single file to copy to run your program (in our https server you should be careful with this file since it has you private key inside it).</p>
        <p>Embed is such a simple and effective tool that I'm not only using for my certificates, but also for the actual public files of this website. It is a way of having a web server without it having access to the file system, which is a nice security feature to have. As I said before, really enjoy using it. Here is a simple code snippet of how to do it in our little server experiment.</p>

        <pre><code class="language-go">//main.go
package main

import (
  "crypto/tls"
  _ "embed"
  "fmt"
  "log"
  "net/http"
)

const port = "8443"

// Go embed uses directives to give you access to the functionality.
// After it you should write the path to the file you want to embed.
// This can also be done with directories, check it here:
// https://pkg.go.dev/embed#hdr-File_Systems

//go:embed first.crt.pem
var firstCrt []byte

//go:embed first.key.pem
var firstKey []byte

//go:embed second.crt.pem
var secondCrt []byte

//go:embed second.key.pem
var secondKey []byte

func main() {
  var mux http.ServeMux
  mux.HandleFunc("/", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, world over HTTPS!\n")
  })

  var certs []tls.Certificate

  // Changed from LoadX509KeyPair to X509KeyPair so we can pass the
  // bytes directly.
  cert, err := tls.X509KeyPair(firstCrt, firstKey)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  certs = append(certs, cert)

  cert, err = tls.X509KeyPair(secondCrt, secondKey)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  certs = append(certs, cert)

  // Everything else stays the same!

        <p>Well, I feel like I have already gone little off topic here. So this must be a sign that I should end this post.</p>
        <p>I know this is no novelty, but this blog is not about bleeding edge knowledge about Go, it is about this unique experience of being a developer and overcoming challenges every day. I really hope this reading has been of good use to you.</p>
